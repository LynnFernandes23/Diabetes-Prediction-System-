# Diabetes-Prediction-System-
The Diabetes Prediction System is a comprehensive web application utilizing HTML for the frontend and Python's Flask framework for the backend. It leverages Pandas and NumPy for efficient data management, employing Scikit-Learn to develop robust machine learning models. Matplotlib is used for insightful data visualization.The system guarantees precise predictions of diabetes outcomes by rigorously preprocessing data and employing a variety of machine learning algorithms. Users access the system through an intuitive HTML interface, facilitating easy interaction and quick access to prediction results. This project demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, seamless integration of machine learning capabilities, and effective application of data visualization techniques for predictive analytics.
